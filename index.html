        <h2>
          THE MEISILE MAN OF INDIA
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of India. He was also an Aerospace Scientist and an Indian
          pioneer in Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Vehicle Technology.

          He was the successor to President K.R. Narayanan, in the year 2002, when he had been nominated by the NDA
          Government and such was his popularity among the people of India that even the largest opposition party, the
          INC, seconded his candidature.

          A Visionary Ahead Of His Time
          Dr. Kalam played a very important role in shaping Indiaâ€™s Ballistic Missile and Launch Vehicle Technology, and
          that too at a time when India was totally dependent upon foreign technology.

          He was part of the INCOSPAR committee (Indian National Committee for Space Research) working under the
          renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai, who had a great impact on his life. He had also visited NASA's
          Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and the
          Wallops Flight Facility
